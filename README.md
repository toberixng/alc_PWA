## ALC Challenge Completion Assessment (#7DaysofCode)

## This challenge is aimed at testing our ability to implement what we have learnt in the Google Africa Scholarship challenge course, 

### Lucky to find myself among the great group of passionate and motivated scholars who are ready to strengthen their skillsets and change their lives. 

### Three partners joined forces to bring this opportunity to many in Africa. The scholarship is funded by Google, powered by Udacity, and learning community is provided by Andela.
